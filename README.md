## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions incur significant losses due to vehicle loan defaults. This has led to stricter underwriting policies and higher rejection rates for loan applicants.

To address this issue, institutions require a robust credit risk scoring system that helps identify high-risk applicants before loan approval.

This project focuses on analyzing customer and loan-related attributes to determine the key factors influencing vehicle loan default and build a predictive model to identify potential defaulters.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Identify determinants of vehicle loan default
- Analyze borrower risk characteristics
- Study behavioral and financial attributes affecting loan repayment
- Build a predictive Logistic Regression model to classify defaulters and non-defaulters
- Support data-driven credit risk assessment
